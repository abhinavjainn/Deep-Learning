# Deep-Learning

Collection of Deep Learning experiments. It is an evolving repository with new sections and experiments being added periodically.

Current components:
1. Computer Vision

      a. Deeper Networks:
          With the advent of the supporting ecosystem for neural network training, Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) have demonstrated remarkable success in the vision tasks. Extensive research in the CNN based computer vision has resulted in deeper networks being used to accomplish more complex vision tasks with significant improvements in task and training performance.
          
      This work analyses and experiments with some of the leading deep networks such as GoogleNet, ResNet34 and VGG19 using datasets MNIST and CIFAR-10.
      
      Library used: PyTorch.
