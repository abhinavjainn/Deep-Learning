# Deep-Learning

Collection of Deep Learning experiments. It is an evolving repository with new sections and experiments being added periodically.

Current components:
1. Computer Vision

      a. Deeper Networks:
          
      This work analyses and experiments with some of the leading deep networks such as GoogleNet, ResNet34 and VGG19 using datasets MNIST and CIFAR-10.
      
      Library used: PyTorch.
      
     b. Super Resolution:
      
      i) SRCNN: Experiments with a pretrained original SRCNN model.
